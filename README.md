## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

For styles


### What I learned

I learnt more about boxes than i previously thought i knew.
Also, found out that not every problem has to be fixed with a flex-box when there are easier ways to solve them.
For instane, i learnt to position a box in the center with;
'''Html
<div class="center-box">This is a box</div>
'''

```css
.center-box{
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```
 I also learnt to load up images and size them accordingly.

### Continued development

Every element in html is a box. So focusing on understanding it completely will prove to be beneficial to me in the long run.
 I would also learn to journal all my process. From planning, coding and learning processes for easier reference.
### Useful resources

I watched alot of youtube videos and read a number of articles, but i did not journal my sources.
